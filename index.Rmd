## Welcome to R

Hopefully by now you've started up RStudio (or your IDE or text editor of choice) and are greeted by a command prompt:

## Say Hello!

As is traditional in programming, we'll start off with a `Hello world!` program. Try the below:

```{r}
print("Hello world!")
```

Don't worry too much about the `[1]` at the beginning, we'll explain that soon.

Note that you can also type `"Hello world!"` without the `print` command and R will assume you meant to print it.

## Some basic maths

We can also use R as a calculator for addition and powers:

```{r}
2 + 2
2 ^ 3
```

Note that there are other operators we can use, like `*` for multiplications, `-` for subtraction and `/` for division.

## Quick quiz

We'll be having a few quizzes like this during this tutorial. No pressure, it's just to check your understanding.

### What is the expected result from `4 / 2`?

1. 1
2. _2_
3. 3
4. 4

*** explanation

It's 2, because 4 ÷ 2 = 2
